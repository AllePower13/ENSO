# ENSO
Python files for El Nino-Souther Oscillation research leaded at CNR-ISAC.

The work was subdivided into macro-topics (Tasks) and so the calculus files are. Every file has a header explaining the content: some theory, micro-tasks/to-do list/workflow, technical notes, and comments on minority results.
